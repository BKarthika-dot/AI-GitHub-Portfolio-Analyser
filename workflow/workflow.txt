🏗️ Architecture Overview

Webhook → GitHub API → Repo Analysis (JS) → AI Agent (LLM)
→ MongoDB Chat Memory → Gmail Report Delivery

This project is implemented as an automated n8n workflow.

Workflow overview:

A Webhook node receives a POST request containing a GitHub username.

During development and testing, Postman was used to send the POST request to the n8n test webhook URL.

The username is passed to a GitHub API HTTP Request node to fetch profile and repository data.

A JavaScript code node analyzes repositories (languages, activity, recency, and overall strength).

An AI Agent node reviews the analysis and generates a career-focused GitHub report.

MongoDB chat memory is used to retain past interactions and track improvement over time.

The final report is sent to the user via Gmail.

Once deployed, the workflow can be triggered programmatically without Postman by calling the production webhook endpoint.
